# Soccer_match_player_info
Soccer-Statistics shows you the statistics of your favorite soccer players. The user should be able to search his favorite players by name and save them in favorite lists. The lists should be editable at any point. The key facts of the last match day of each player should be displayed as an abstract. This includes Date, Location, Opponent, Result, Position played, Goals, Assists, Yellow Card, Red Card, and minutes played. In addition, data about the player himself, such as market value, Birthday, height, nationality, place of birth, position, and career should be viewable. Furthermore, all key facts of past matches of the player should be viewable when needed. By clicking on the result of a match, the most important facts of the match should appear. That would be the Line-ups and substitutes of the two teams, the goals, the cards, and the name of the referee.

who would use it: The user of this software could be many different groups, for example normal soccer fans, player agencies tracking the statistics of their players, scouts from different clubs searching for new talents, or player consultants.
